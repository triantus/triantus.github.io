  <br>
  Educated in International Business (MsD), V is working for a first class shipping company in London for 3 years now after the little adventure he had 
  with the first company he was working for, that didn't seem to be able to pay him for his services.  <!-- content -->

  He is also profficient with Mixed Martial Arts and awarded the second place to Italy's national championship at the age of 22. A hobby that he still practises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likes dark themed stuff, sometimes even wears green eye-contacts while his natural eye color is black, a strong personality, a devoted single. 
  Would need a lot of effort to agitate a disciplined mind like his. Just make sure you keep a safe distance if you acomplish it.
