First the index page is being created before everything. 
On that stage, some brainstorming took place to plan the design of the website.
The intention is to make a functional website, comfortable for the eye and as simple as possible. 
mod.css file is created in order to style the main logo and header that will be used on every page of the website.
Also there is an image added for the body. Dark grey is chosen hence he letters will be white.(except the title that will just have red shadow)

Next, the bio page is created, and content is added. Some words about the character and an image of him.
In index content is added as well. A welcoming text and an image of the character, different than the one in bio page.
Splitting the image and text of index, in order to style them separatelly.

Next, styling the bio page.
Cv page is created as well. Content is added there as well. The content of these pages was written on site, as the character that is described is a fictionary character created by me.
Footers with a basic copyright text is added on every page.Also styled.
